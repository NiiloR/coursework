## Web development 2 - Group project

This is the main project of the course web development 2 from spring 2024. The task for the project was to create a small web application for a sandwich shop that would enable the user to make orders and see their progression live from the web site. 
The application includes a React front-end, two back-end node.js servers, a RabbitMQ message broker and a MySQL database which handle the tasks related to the orders and simulates the process of producing the order by giving a delayed response. The whole application is containerized with docker for easy deployment. 
Check out Pictures of the application.pdf for quick look of the application and documentation.pdf for more information about the system, tools, architechture and setup.
