This is a slightly modified version of an assignment done at course 
Functional programming 1. The project was to make a small calendar proggram that 
can save events given by the user and display information about those events,
dates and places. All variables in user input have to be in single quotes to
work correctly.
Most base code given by the course are separated into Date_stuff module and can be 
found in a separate file.
To run the program in GHCI type "ghc --make Calendar.hs" to compile the program 
and then "/.Calendar" to run it
